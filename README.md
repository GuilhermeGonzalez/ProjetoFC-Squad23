### Problem
"We know how difficult it is for parents to buy school supplies for their children. Prices increase from semester to semester. Especially when it comes to public education, where the difficulty is even greater and comes from various factors..."

### The Solution
A crowdfunding website was created taking into account the real need, seeking to cover the majority of the scenario. On this site, it is possible to register the beneficiary and customize the list of materials, setting a specific goal.
The donor will basically enter the site, filter which donation they want to contribute to, and make the online payment.
